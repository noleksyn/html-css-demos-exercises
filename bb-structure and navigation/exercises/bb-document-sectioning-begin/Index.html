    <h2>Leagues</h2>
    <p>We offer both classic and head to head leagues, as well as private and public leagues.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Classic Leagues:</dt>
             <dd>In classic leagues teams are ranked based on the total number of points scored by their players throughout
            the season.</dd>
        <dt>Head To Head Leagues:</dt>
            <dd>In head to head leagues each team plays against another opponent each week of the season. Just like the
            Premier League, a win is worth 3 points, a draw is worth 1 point, and a loss is worth 0 points.</dd>
        <dt>Private Leagues:</dt>
            <dd>Private leagues work the same way as public leagues except they require a password to join them. Private
            leagues also allow the league creator to manually start the draft with the click of a button. Public leagues
            start automatically at a given date. Also, settings for private leagues can be changed before the draft
            starts, whereas the settings in public leagues can't be changed.</dd>

    <h2>Picking a well balanced team. </h2>
    <p>
        This refers to both price and teams. Teams: Selecting your FPL team from a range of teams ensures you are well
        covered in the event that one side does particularly well or badly in any given weekend. Price: Ensure that the
        selection of 1-3 high price players is not at the expense of the rest of your team. It is important that not
        only 1-3 players are relied upon to score all of your points. If there is an injury, or if the players form
        drops, it can hurt your points in a big way.
